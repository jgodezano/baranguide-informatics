                PENALIZING THE MALICIOUS DISTRIBUTION OF FALSE NEWS AND OTHER
                RELATED VIOLATIONS</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Philippines in
                Congress assembled:<br><br>
                SECTION 1. Title. This Act shall be known as the <a style="color: rgb(179, 0, 0);">“Anti-Fake News Act of 2017.”</a><br><br>
                SECTION 2. <a style="color: rgb(179, 0, 0);">Malicious Creation and Distribution of False News</a>. It shall be unlawful for
                any person to maliciously offer, publish, distribute, circulate and spread false news or
                information or cause the publication, distribution, circulation or spreading of the same in
                print, broadcast or online media, provided that, such false news or information cause or
                tend to cause panic, division, chaos, violence, hate or which exhibit or tend to exhibit a
                propaganda to blacken or discredit one’s reputation and the person knowingly commits

                grounds to believe that the same is false.<br><br>
                SECTION 3. Any person who shall be found guilty of committing any of the foregoing acts shall be

                Million Pesos (P5,000,000)</a> and <a style="color: rgb(179, 0, 0);">imprisonment ranging from one (1) to five (5) years</a>.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATORY NOTE</strong></p>
            <p>The advent of modern technology has caused a shift from traditional news reporting in print
                and broadcast media to the internet, especially on social media platforms. This has gained
                special significance during the 2016 national elections, where, reportedly, numerous fake
                accounts were created calculated to spread false news.</p>
            <p>It is not surprising, therefore, that we hear and read the phrase “fake news” every day.
                Indeed, the effect of fake news should not be taken lightly. Fake news creates impressions
                and beliefs based on false premises leading to division, misunderstanding and further
                exacerbating otherwise tenuous relations.</p>
            <p>In May 2017, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, General Aho,
                ordered the investigation of a complaint against soldiers who posted their comments
                following a fake news posted online.1 This incident is only one of the recent events that
                illustrates why the proliferation of fake news should not be tolerated and its authors and
                distributors penalized accordingly, especially when the public interest is at stake.
                In Germany, a bill was recently approved penalizing social networking sites for their failure
                to immediately remove illegal contents and imposing fines of up to Fifty Million Euros.</p>
            <p>This bill seeks to penalize any person who maliciously offer, publish, distribute, circulate
                and spread false news or information or cause the publication, distribution, circulation or
                spreading of the same in print, broadcast or online media. To be covered under this Act,
                such false news or information must cause or tend to cause panic, division, chaos, violence,
                hate or must exhibit or tend to exhibit a propaganda to blacken or discredit one’s reputation.
                In addition, the person doing any of the foregoing acts must have full knowledge that such
                news or information is false, or have reasonable grounds to believe that the same is false.</p>
            <p><strong>Any person who will be found guilty of committing any of the foregoing acts will be punished
                by a fine ranging from <a style="color: rgb(179, 0, 0);">One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000)</a> to <a style="color: rgb(179, 0, 0);">Five Million Pesos
                (P5,000,000)</a> and <a style="color: rgb(179, 0, 0);">imprisonment ranging from one (1) to five (5) years</a>. Stiffer penalties will
                be imposed if the offender is a public official.<br><br>
                In addition, this bill proposes to penalize any mass media enterprise or social media
                platform that fails, neglects or refuses to remove false news or information within a
                reasonable period after having knowledge, or having reasonable grounds to believe, of its
                falsity. Violators will be punished by a fine ranging from <a style="color: rgb(179, 0, 0);">Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000)</a> to
                <a style="color: rgb(179, 0, 0);">Twenty Million Pesos (P20,000,000)</a> and <a style="color: rgb(179, 0, 0);">imprisonment ranging from ten (10) to twenty (20)
                years</a>. If the offender is a corporation, the President, Chief Executive Officer and other
                responsible officers will suffer the penalty of imprisonment.</strong></p>
            <p>The passage of this bill will encourage our citizens, especially public officers, to be more
                responsible and circumspect in creating, distributing and/or sharing news. Addressing
                national and global concerns should not be made more complicated by false news
                calculated to cause disunity, panic, chaos and/or violence.
                Thus, the immediate passage of this bill is sought.</p><br>
